# Suduko-Solver

Program created in Python using the Pygame module.

This program offers a GUI for the user to input the starting numbers for a Suduko Grid. After checking for invalid grids, the program will then find and display the completed grid achieved by using the backtracking algorithm. The GUI comes with buttons to clear the board so that multiple boards may be solved in one instance of the program.
